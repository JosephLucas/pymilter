Reporting explanation for failure should show source of sender
provided explanation.

Reports PROBATION even when rejecting message (works, but confusing in log).

Bug in Auto-whitelist.  Recent Auto-whitelist doesn't override expired entry.

DONE Delayed_failure detection needs to handle multi-line header fields.  
Also, delayed_failure should be recognized when addressed to
postmaster@helodomain 

Need to use wildcards in blacklist.log: *.madcowsrecord.net
Need to exclude emails like !*-admin@example.com in whitelist_sender.

SPF permerror diagnostics should include corrected mechanism.

Delay SPF check until RCPT TO.  Cache result to avoid repeating
for multiple RCPT.  This avoids overhead for invalid RCPT, and
allows for per RCPT local policy.

Add auto-blacklisted senders to blacklist.log with timestamp.

Received-SPF header field should show identity that was checked.

Check SPF for outgoing mail (including local policy for internal addresses).
This could also solve the second part of the mail from relay problem below.

Whitelisted sender from trusted relay get PROBATION.  Need to extracted
SPF result from headers - and in the case of mail internal to relay
(e.g. bmsi.com), supply 'pass' result.  

FIXME: DSN for Permerror shows 'None' for error under some condition.

Another metaDSN format:
Subject: Delivery Report
...
Original-Envelope-ID: SRS0...@...

For selected domains, check rcpts via CBV before accepting mail.  Cache
results.  This will kick out dictonary attacks against a mail domain
behind a gateway sooner.

Allow blacklisted emails as well as domains in blacklist.log.  Use same
data structure as autowhitelist.log.  Add emails blacklisted via CBV
so that they are remembered across milter restarts.

Make all dictionaries work like honeypot.  Do not train as ham unless
whitelisted.  Train on blacklisted messages, or spam feedback.  This
can be called Train On Error.  Should be possible to startup
with training on everything to get dictionary built fast, then switch
to train on error to minimize labor.

Allow unsigned DSNs from selected domains (that don't accept signed MFROM,
e.g. verizon.net).

Added Message-ID header to DSN with SRS signed sender.  When seen on incoming
rfc ignorant failure message, blacklist sender.

Allow verified hostnames for trusted_relay.  E.g. HELO name that
passes SPF.

Table of sendmail macros for documentation.

When do we get two hello calls?  STARTTLS is one reason.

Option: accept mail from auto-whitelisted senders even with spf-fail,
but do not update dspam.  This can be done for individual senders or domains 
using the access file.

pysrs: SRS doesn't get applied to proper recipients when there are
multiple recipients.  This requires debugging cf scripts - yuk.

auto_whitelist false_positives from quarantine - perhaps only when
user selects special button (use special header to communicate
that from dspamcgi.py to milter.)

Use send_dsn.log for blacklist also.  AddrCache needs localpart
wildcard (e.g. empty localpart).

Quarantined mail is missing headers modified/added by milter after
checking dspam.

Require signed MFROM for all incoming bounces when signing all outgoing mail -
except from trusted relays.

Send DSN for permerror before processing extended result.  An additional
DSN may be sent based on extended result.

Rescind whitelist for banned extensions, in case sender is infected.

Train honeypot on error only.

Find rfc2822 policy for MFROM quoting.

Support explicit errors for SPF policy in access file:
SPF-Neutral:aol.com	ERROR:"550 AOL mail must get SPF PASS"

Defer TEMPERROR in SPF evaluation - give precedence to security
(only defer for PASS mechanisms).

Option to add Received-SPF header, but never reject on SPF.
  I think the above will handle this.

Create null config that does nothing - except maybe add Received-SPF
headers.  Many admins would like to turn features on one at a time.

Can't output messages with malformed rfc822 attachments.

Move milter,Milter,mime,spf modules to pymilter
milter package will have bms.py application

Web admin interface
message log for automated stats and blacklisting
Skip dspam when SPF pass? NO
Report 551 with rcpt on SPF fail?
check spam keywords with character classes, e.g.
	{a}=[a@гд], {i}=[i1н], {e}=[eл], {o}=[o0ц]

Implement RRS - a backdoor for non-SRS forwarders.  User lists non-SRS 
forwarder accounts, and a util provides a special local alias for the
user to give to the forwarder.  (Or user just adds arbitrary alias
unique to that forwarder to a database.)  Alias only works for mail from that
forwarder.  Milter gets forwarder domain from alias and uses it to
SPF check forwarder.

Framework for modular Python milter components within a single VM.
Python milters can be already be composed through sendmail by running each in
a separate process.  However, a significant amount of memory is wasted
for each additional Python VM, and communication between milters
is cumbersome (e.g., adding mail headers, writing external files).

Backup copies for outgoing/incoming mail.

Copy incoming wiretap mail, even though sendmail alias works perfectly
for the purpose, to avoid having to change two configs for a wiretap.

Provide a way to reload milter.cfg without stopping/restarting milter.

Allow selected Windows extensions for specific domains via milter.cfg

Fix setup.py so that _FFR_QUARANTINE is automatically defined when
available in libmilter.

Keep separate ismodified flag for headers and body.  This is important
when rejecting outgoing mail with viruses removed (so as not to
embarrass yourself), and also removing Received headers with hidepath.

Need a test module to feed sample messages to a milter though a live 
sendmail and SMTP.  The mockup currently used is probably not very accurate,
and doesn't test the threading code.
